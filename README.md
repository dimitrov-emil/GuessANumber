A simple game where one has to gues a Number between 1 and 100, randomly chosen by the computer.
Hints of whether one's choice is under or above the Number are given after every try.
One wins the game when one guesses the Number.

Rules:
1. One's guess should be a whole positive number;
2. one has 5 tries only. Than the game is over!
